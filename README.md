# ObliqueProjectileMotionSimulation
A physics simulation of Oblique Projectile Motion for learning purposes. Oblique projectile motion happens when an object is launched into the air at an angle. The object follows a curved path, affected by gravity and air resistance. Calculating the trajectory can be complex, but it's important in fields like engineering and sports. _This simulation disregards air resistance._
